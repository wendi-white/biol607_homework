1. Load quakes with data(quakes). Show what’s there with str() and summary().

```{r}
data(quakes)
str(quakes)
summary(quakes)
```


2. Show the entirity of the column long.
```{r}
quakes$long
```

3. Hey, another useful function - unique()! Apply it to a vector, and you can see what are all of the unique values. It’s great for really digging into a problematic vector. What unique stations are there? 
```{r}
unique(quakes$stations)
```


4. Use length() with unique() to determine how many stations there are.

```{r}
length(unique(quakes$stations))
```
5. Using range(), what is the range of depths where quakes occur?
```{r}
range(quakes$depth)
```
E.C. Where was the earthquake of largest magnitude found? You’ll need to use some comparisons and the max() function for this in your indices instead of a number!

```{r}
max(quakes$mag, na.rm = FALSE)
which(quakes$mag== 6.4)
quakes[152,]
```








```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
